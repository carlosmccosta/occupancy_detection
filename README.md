# occupancy_detection

This ROS package provides a node and library that can be used to detect when something enters or moves inside a given 3D [region / box] being observed by a 3D sensor.

It can be used to develop interactive immersive human-machine interfaces, such as operator training / teaching done in the package [assembly_projection_mapping_teaching](https://github.com/carlosmccosta/assembly_projection_mapping_teaching).
